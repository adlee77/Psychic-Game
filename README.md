# Psychic-Game
I have created the Psychic Game in which, the computer randomly picks a letter and the user has 9 attempts to guess the correct letter. 

When creating this game, I started with a basic HTML page that contained all the necessary headers and paragraphs (wins, losses, attempts, etc.). I enclosed the <p> tags that had changing variables with <span> tags. I then linked the HTML page to my .JS page.

When starting my .JS page, I tried to create all my Variables first to make sure they were global and I had things to reference. The hardest one was finding how to create the random letter generator. I decided to use a Math.random function and use the Math.floor function to round it to a whole number.

I had to learn how to create a reset function and learning how to register the keyboard clicks were a bit difficult. I'm sure there is an easier way to write out the code for onkeypress, but I didn't know how to do it and I had to look up how to get it to work on google. 

I'm starting to feel more comfortable with Javascript after this assignment, but the Word Game was too difficult and daunting a task. I thought the Psychich Game proved to be a challenging task that I learned a lot from.
